To use this with [TrenchBroom](https://github.com/TrenchBroom), copy over the `ElegyEngine` directory to your TrenchBroom installation's `games` directory, for example: `C:/Program Files/TrenchBroom/games/`.

This works with TrenchBroom 2024.1, while 2024.2 wasn't tested and 2025.x is not supported yet.
