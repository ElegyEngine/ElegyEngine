Finally, it was about time I talked about this as well. Elegy's UI system.

In short, while ImGui is fine for debug menus and such, it's not really adequate for extensive in-game and tooling menus. Solutions like RmlUI are good for in-game GUI, however it's in C++. I would prefer a C#-only solution.

I figured, it wouldn't be a bad idea to tackle this problem myself. Essentially, build a lightweight UI library without too many fancy features. Something that will be good enough for basic game GUI needs as well as basic app/tool needs.

Besides, I've wanted to explore some alternative approaches to UI, and hopefully make it fairly data-driven too. It would be driven by C# scripts, as described in the [scripting system](2024-10-09-scripting.md) blog.

## Requirements, scope, architecture

So let's discuss the requirements and scope a bit. With this UI library, I'd like to have the following:

* Vector font text rendering.
* UI panels (rectangles).
* Containers: vbox, hbox, grid, scrollbox.
* Docking support for tools.
* Styling:
	* Defined in external files.
	* Animation.
* Plenty of widgets out of the box:
	* Colour pickers.
	* Buttons.
	* Images.
	* Labels.
	* Text input.
	* Popup/context menu widget.
* Events: on mouse hover/click/hold/release, on key pressed/released etc.

Fundamentally, it'd be architected like so, with the following concepts:
* Panels:
	* These are the building blocks of the UI system. The system manipulates with lists and trees of `Panel` objects. They themselves are very barebones, equipped with a few events, a few callbacks, some basic builtin info, and a databag.
* Widgets:
	* These are methods that fill in a `Panel` with some concrete event handling logic and rendering logic.
* Windows:
	* These are objects that fundamentally spawn and manage all widgets. They themselves are panels too!
* Styles:
	* Finally, these are a bit like CSS. They just define colours, sizes, fonts and animations/transitions.

## Vision

Here's a form example:

```cs title="MainMenu.cs"
using Elegy.UI;

// Imports MenuButton
using static Example.UI.MenuContainers;
// Imports Hbox, Vbox, Filler etc.
using static Elegy.UI.Containers;

public class MainMenu : Window
{
	// This is called once
	public override Panel Emit() // Window.Emit
		=> FullscreenPanel( // Covers the whole screen
			Hbox( // Horizontal box
				Vbox( // Vertical box to store main menu buttons
					Filler(), // Yes, what you see below are localised strings
					MenuButton( "#MENU_StartGame", OnStartGame, Align.Left ),
					MenuButton( "#MENU_LoadGame", OnLoadGame, Align.Left ),
					MenuButton( "#MENU_Settings", OnSettings, Align.Left ),
					Filler( size: 20 ),
					MenuButton( "#MENU_Quit", OnQuitGame, Align.Left ),
					Filler()
				),
				Filler() // Fill the right half of the screen
				// Alternatively, you may use a grid here
			)
		);

	private void OnStartGame()
		=> ...;
	private void OnLoadGame()
		=> ...;
	private void OnSettings()
		=> ...;
	private void OnQuitGame()
		=> ...;
}
```

Here's a widget example:
```cs title="ColorPickerWidget.cs"
using Elegy.UI;

public class ColorPickerData : IWidgetData
{
	public Vector4 Color { get; set; } = Vector4.One;
	public List<Vector4> ColorHistory { get; set; } = [];
}

public static class ColorPickerWidget
{
	public static void OnRender( UiRenderContext context )
	{
		//...
	}

	public static Panel ColorPicker()
	{
		Panel panel = new();

		panel.OnRender = OnRender;
		panel.DataBag = new ColorPickerData();

		return self;
	}
}
```

That is an example of a more advanced widget. You may also simply define widgets as an extension method that calls others, combines other widgets to act as a bigger one:

```cs title="ColumnUtilities.cs"
using Elegy.UI;
using static Elegy.UI.Containers;

public static class ColumnUtilities
{
	public static Panel DoubleColumn( Panel leftChild, Panel rightChild )
		=> Hbox( leftChild, VLine(), rightChild );

	public static Panel TripleColumn( Panel leftChild, Panel middleChild, Panel rightChild )
		=> Hbox( leftChild, VLine(), middleChild, VLine(), rightChild );
}
```

Here's a docking example:
```cs title="MapEditor.cs"
using Elegy.UI;
using static Elegy.UI.Containers;

using static MapEditor.UI.Browsers;
using static MapEditor.UI.Editors;
using static MapEditor.UI.Inspectors;

public class MapEditorUi : Window
{
	public override Panel Emit()
		=> Dock(
			// This is an optional default layout
			DockVbox(
				Toolbar(),
				DockHbox(
					MapEditorFrame(),
					DockHbox(
						EntityInspector(),
						WorldInspector(),
						ScriptInspector()
					)
				),
				DockHbox(
					MapEditorMessages(),
					AssetBrowser()
				),
				StatusBar()
			)
		);
}
```

Finally here is also a more dynamic, conditional UI example:
```cs title="DebugMenu.cs"
using Elegy.UI;

public class DebugMenu : Window
{
	public bool Chance()
		=> Random.Shared.GetNext() > 5000;

	public override Panel Emit()
		=> Vbox(
			// Example 1: simple conditional
			Conditional(
				predicate: Chance,
				ifTrue: () => Label( "Now you see me :)" )
			),
			// Example 2: if-else conditional
			Conditional(
				predicate: Chance,
				ifTrue: () => Label( "Luck is on your side!" ),
				ifFalse: () => Label( "Luck is NOT on your side :(" )
			),
			// Example 3: conditional chain
			// Though you may also chain Conditional
			// multiple times on ifFalse
			ConditionalChain(
				{
					Predicate = Chance,
					Action = () => Label( "Luck is 1" )
				},
				{
					Predicate = Chance,
					Action = () => Label( "Luck is 2" )
				},
				{
					Predicate = Chance,
					Action = () => Label( "Luck is 3" )
				}
			)
		);
}
```

Finally, here's an example of a couple styles:
```css title="style-light.css"
.primary
{
	background-color: rgb( 220, 220, 220, 1.0 );
	color: rgb( 15, 15, 15, 1.0 );
}

/*.secondary, .tertiary etc.*/

.button
{
	background-color: rgb( 15, 15, 15, 0.7 );
	color: rgb( 220, 220, 220, 1.0 );

	transition: color 0.25s, background-color 0.25s;
}

.button:hover
{
	background-color: rgb( 20, 20, 20, 0.7 );
	color: rgb( 230, 230, 230, 1.0 );

	transition: color 0.25s, background-color 0.25s;
}
```

```css title="style-dark.css"
.primary
{
	background-color: rgb( 32, 32, 32, 1.0 );
	color: rgb( 200, 200, 200, 1.0 );
}

/*.secondary, .tertiary etc.*/
```

```css title="custom.css"
/* A fancy button class */
.button-fancy
{
	background-color: rgb( 64, 48, 16, 0.7 );
}
```

```cs title="StyleExample.cs
// Usage example
renderContext.StyleManager.Load( "ui/styles/custom.css" );

return Vbox(
	Button( "Normal button" ),
	Button( "Fancy button :)" ).Style( "secondary button-fancy" )
);
```
