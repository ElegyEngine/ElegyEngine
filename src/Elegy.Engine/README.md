The core of a "virtual game engine" that runs on top of Godot 4.0, specialised for developing retro-style first-person shooters and similar games from the late 90s and early 2000s.  
It is launched by [Elegy.Launcher](https://github.com/ElegyEngine/ElegyLauncher) which also provides it access to a GodotSharp instance.

Check out [Elegy.TestGame](https://github.com/ElegyEngine/Elegy.TestGame) for an example game module.

*Note: early WiP, check back in Q4 2023!*
